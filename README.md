Bootstrap Scripts for Full-Stack Developers
=========

Scripts and descriptors for different kind of situations when I need to bootstrap any environment from scratch

* Cassandra
* NewRelic monitoring agents and plugins
* Oracle JDK one-liner
* Percona Cluster
* Redis Server
* Zabbis Server
* Zookeeper & Exhibitor Bootstrap

Main idea behind the scripts is in providing example for setting up corresponding system or application with short descriptions of common gotchas.
